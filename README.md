Code to generate the images knit into KnitYak https://knityak.com scarves and wraps.

The Mandelbrot scarves are slices of the Mandelbrot set knit into wearable scarves. They navigate to coordinates on the Mandelbrot set with a designated zoom factor and a set number of iterations. The code allows you to navigate the Mandelbrot set and see a larger rectangle around the slice you choose. The resulting image is saved, and the knits are one pixel = one knit stitch in the finished product.

The CYBER scarf is code to generate a fun reversible knit object. The characters of the word cyber, C Y B E R, are individually placed because the chosen font was not truly monospaced. They are interleaved with a version that is mirrored and rotated 180 degrees to allow the text to be read correctly from both sides of a double bed jacquard scarf. The mirrored versions read true for mirror selfies of course.
